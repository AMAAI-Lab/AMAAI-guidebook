What Is Linux?
Linux powers a variety of computer systems from light bulbs to guns, laptops to large computer centers. Linux powers everything from your phone to your smart refrigerator.


In desktop computing, Linux provides an alternative to commercial operating systems such as Windows and macOS. 

Linux sources from some of the earliest computer operating systems from the 1960s and 1970s, and so it retains its root philosophies of strong user-level security, customization, and system stability.
