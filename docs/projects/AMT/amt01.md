# Problem Formulation
Given a spectrogram $ùëã\in \mathbb{R}^{F \times T}$,
we want to obtain a posteriorgram $Y_{\text{post}}\in [0,1]^{88\times T}$ via a neural network model $Y_{\text{post}}=f(X)$.
The piano roll $Y\in \{0,1\}^{88\times T}$ can be obtained via applying a hard threshold on $Y_{\text{post}}$.
